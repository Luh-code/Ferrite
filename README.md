# Ferrite
Ferrite is a codelessly configurable state-machine management system, using XML for configuration.
Ferrite can be configured to work with any real world machine, as long as a ferrite compliant server for that machine is provided for ferrite to connect to.
# DISCLAIMER
Ferrite is still early in development and is not intended for "real applications" or any sort of no-supervision 24/7 installations.
Ferrite in it's current state is not usable yet.
In the future there will also follow detailed documentation on the usage, configuration and server-writing for machines. This is not ready yet though.
